# AndroidASCIITextArt

Hello everyone! I have finally created my first every GitHub repository on one of my newest Android apps!
This app is an ASCII Text Art and Emoji app with copy and paste functions to use your favorite faces make from text symbols!

I know it's not the most original design, but I am fresh out of app ideas. There are a few other apps I have made that I would like to make their own repo for,
that will happen sometime soon.

You can download this app on Google Play <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toxicflame427.asciiart" target="_blank">here</a>

Check out more on the app on my website at <a href="https://www.toxicflame427.xyz/pages/app_pages/ascii_text_art.html" target="_blank">https://toxicFlame427.xyz/</a>
